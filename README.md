# Hybrid Hypergraph Modularity Optimization

## Overview

This repository implements a hybrid approach to hypergraph community detection by combining embedding-based clustering with H-Louvain algorithm. The goal is to improve modularity optimization in hypergraphs through a two-stage process.

## Methodology

### The Hybrid Approach

1. **Hypergraph Embedding**: Transform the hypergraph structure into a vector space representation
2. **Initial Clustering**: Apply clustering algorithms to the embeddings to identify initial communities
3. **H-Louvain Refinement**: Use the initial clusters as starting points for H-Louvain algorithm
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Compare results with standalone EC-Louvain and H-Louvain approaches

## Implementation Details

### Hypergraph Embedding

We implement various embedding techniques for hypergraphs, which capture the higher-order relationships between nodes.

### Clustering Methods

After obtaining node embeddings, we apply clustering algorithms to identify initial community structures.

### H-Louvain Initialization

Instead of random initialization, we use the clusters obtained from embedding-based methods as the starting point for H-Louvain.

## Expected Outcomes

- Improved modularity scores compared to standalone methods
- Better community detection in complex hypergraphs
- Potentially faster convergence of the H-Louvain algorithm

## Results and Analysis

This section will be updated with experimental results and performance comparisons.
